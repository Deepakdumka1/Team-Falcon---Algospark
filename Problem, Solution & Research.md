## 🧩 Problem Statement

In competitive programming, technical interviews, and academic learning, students often struggle to understand and apply algorithms efficiently. While many resources exist, they are either too theoretical or lack clear, structured implementations.

### As a result:
- Learners find it hard to map problem statements to the right algorithms  
- Code solutions are often complex, poorly explained, or inconsistent  
- There is no single place offering well-organized, optimized, and readable algorithmic solutions  

This creates a gap between learning algorithms and applying them effectively in real problems.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**Team Falcon – AlgoSpark** aims to bridge this gap by providing a well-structured repository of algorithmic solutions with a focus on clarity, correctness, and practical usability.

### Our solution offers:
- 📌 Curated algorithm implementations for common and important problem types  
- 📘 Clean, readable code that is easy to understand for beginners  
- ⚡ Optimized approaches to demonstrate best practices  

### 🧠 Learning-Oriented Structure
- Identify the right algorithm  
- Understand its logic  
- Apply it to similar problems  

This repository serves as a **learning aid, reference guide, and practice resource** for students preparing for coding contests, exams, and interviews.
